        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Devin Cooley and I am tired of hearing about your love of dancing barefoot in the moonlight and rain, feeling the sand/grass between your toes. Sure all that spiritual stuff is great, but in my experience,nobody who has to walk barefoot everyday chooses to do so. Shoes are a privelidge and something to be grateful for. </p>
